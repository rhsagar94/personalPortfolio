Welcome to my personal website. Here is the link to the website https://ornate-otter-80668d.netlify.app

Technology Used:

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build my website.

User Stories:

1. As a user, I wanted my website to look clean.

2. As a user, I wanted to have easy navigation on the site.

3. As a user, I wanted my website to have my personal bio included.

4. As a user, I wanted my website to have my resume and previous works included.

5. As a user, I wanted my website to have my option to contact me.

Unsolved Problems or Major hurdles:

I wanted to store the information put on the contact page to be stored somewhere. So far I have found that it requires the knowledge of backend programming which I do not possess currently.

I was struggling a lot with the css part at the beginning of my project. Then I learned to inspect the specific element and how to make changes to them. That solved my problem.
